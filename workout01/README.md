The purpose of this assignment is threefold: 

1) From the logistical point of view, this assignment will give students the opportunity to start working a more complex file structure, and uploading files to GitHub.

2) From the analytics point of view, this HW involves visualizing shot data of NBA players. More especifially, students will be producing so-called "shot charts" for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries and visualizations.

3) From the report/communication standpoint, students will have to produce a report document that is not just a boring list of code-and-output without a narrative.
