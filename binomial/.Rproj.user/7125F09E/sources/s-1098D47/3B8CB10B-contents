##Brief introduction of package 'binomial'

"binomial" is a package that implements functions for calculating probabilities of a binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.

##Probabilities of a binomial random variable

You can get the probability of a Binomial random variable  by specifying the arguments "success", "trials", and "prob" of function 'bin_probability()'.

```{r}
#To get the probability
bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

Here "success" can also be a numeric vector, but "trials" and "prob" should be a number. And the function returns a vector containing the corresponding probability.

##Related calculations

Besides the probability, you can also get related calculations with the following functions.

You can get the parameters of the binomial distribution by specifying the arguments "trials" and "prob" of the function "bin_variable()". 

```{r}
#To get the parameters
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10 ,prob = 0.3)
bin1
```

The output should be an object of class "binvar". And use function "summary()" to get a nice table of the summary measures for this binomial distribution.

```{r}
#To get the summary measures
summary(bin1)
```

You can get the probability distribution by specifying the arguments "trials" and "success" of the function "bin_distribution()".

```{r}
#To get the probability distribution
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5 ,prob = 0.5)
dis1
```

The output should be an object of class "bindis". Use "plot()" to get the probability histogram .

```{r fig.show='hold'}
#To get the probability histogram
plot(dis1)
```

You can get the cumulative distribution by specfying the arguments "trials" and "success" of the function "bin_cumulative()".

```{r}
dis2 <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5 ,prob = 0.5)
dis2
```

The output should be an object of class "bincum". Use "plot()" to get the graph of cumulative distribution.

```{r fig.show='hold'}
plot(dis2)
```

In case you need calculate the number of combinations in which k success can occur in n trials, the package provides "bin_choose()" function. You can do that by specifying the arguments "trials" and "success".

```{r}
#To get the number of combinations 
bin_choose(n = 5, k = 2)
```


##Summary measures

You can get the related summary measures of the binomial distribution specified (you should specify the argument 'trials' and 'prob') with the following functions.

```{r}
#To get the mean
bin_mean(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
#To get the variance
bin_variance(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
#To get the mode
bin_mode(trials = 10, prob =0.3)
#To get the skewness
bin_skewness(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
#To get the kurtosis
bin_kurtosis(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
```
